# TaskTrack
So, about this project TaskTrack is a web-based system designed for admins and employees to manage tasks more efficiently. Admins can assign and track tasks, while employees can view and update their progress. It replaces manual methods like emails and spreadsheets, making task management clearer, more organized, and easier to follow.
